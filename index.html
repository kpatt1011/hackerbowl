              	<p>Let's face it, Hackathons are a dime a dozen these days. Every company or school insists on putting on their own version of a "Hackathon", and they always seem to mess it up. The Hacker Bowl is redefining the traditional Hackathon, rather than just competing for individual glory, each team is competing for their school. Being "The Best Hacker College in Texas" is a presigious honor, and only one school will get to hoist the Hacker Bowl Trophy. </p>
              	<p>On March 12, 2014 a new competition will be born. The Hacker Bowl is a competition to determine the best best Hacker College in Texas. Do you have what it takes to impress the panel of high-tech judges? Do you have what it takes to bring your school Hacker glory to your school?</p>
                <p>
                  College Station, TX — March XX 2014 — For 24 hours starting at 2pm on Saturday
                  March XX, individuals and teams from Texas schools including Texas A&M,
                  University of Texas, Rice University, Baylor University, and University of
                  Houston will compete for the XX Trophy to determine this year’s Texas school
                  with the best up and coming programmers and designers. The winning school will
                  have their names inscribed on the trophy before bringing it back to their school
                  to showcase until next year’s Hacker Bowl.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But it’s not just a trophy that is up for grabs. There will be $XX,XXX in prize
                  money, with an overall Best Hack prize of $XX,XXX. Both non-students and students
                  are eligible to compete for cash prizes in this free-to-attend event.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Hacker Bowl grew out of AggieHack, a student run hackathon at Texas A&M which had
                  more than 100 Aggie students participate in last year’s inaugural event. With thatCollege Station, TX — March XX 2014 — For 24 hours starting at 2pm on Saturday March XX, individuals and teams from Texas schools including Texas A&M, University of Texas, Rice University, Baylor University, and University of Houston will compete for the XX Trophy to determine this year’s Texas school with the best up and coming programmers and designers. The winning school will have their names inscribed on the trophy before bringing it back to their school to showcase until next year’s Hacker Bowl.


                  kind of demand from one school and an attitude toward making everything bigger in
                  Texas, The Hacker Bowl was born as a state-wide event with 300+ participants.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although the Aggies have their eye on the trophy, a range of judges from various
                  home towns are coming in from all over the state to determine the winner. In the
                  coming weeks, more information and details about the prizes, judges, partners,
                  and the keynote speaker will be shared. There are a limited number of spots, so
                  if you are interested in participating, make sure to register on hackerbowl.io.
